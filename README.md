# ElastAlert-GUI
GUI for ElastAlert (for Elastic Stack ELK) to manage, edit, run rules
The tool is basically a Django Web to provide UI for administrator to create, edit or manage their ElastAlert rules instead of using CLI on ELK server.

The code is an initial beta version and is being in developement. Please inbox me for production usage and feature development.
